#Write down what I learned everyday

##2015.03.22
* Learned how to read from a file in Python
* How to create a text file
* How to in/output
* Even practiced a little bit with Git (amazing tool, though can be hard to use)
* And here I'm using Markdown!(found myself quite love reading out its name...)

##2015.03.23
* Learned the difference between open+'w' and open+'a' (which caused some trouble)
* Tried to dump some pictures from Web but failed :(
* Got more familiar with Git, found myself understood those messy instuctions now :)
* Add new function to my little program

##2015.03.24
* Spent most of the day trying to figure out how to use SSH instead of https, so frustrating... And it just come to me when I was going to give up and this was from a blog teaching you how to set up a blog website using GitHub. :(
* Wrote 4 python exercises from `Learn Python the Hard Way` since I've read `A byte of python`. Typed a lot of things.
* Tried to figure out how to set up a blog using Ruby, bundler and jekelly but failed. Tried Hexo but also failed. I have to admit that I really need a teacher! (clearly not myself!)
* Got more and more familiar with Git, which is definitely a good thing!
* Finished my first course `Data Scientist's tool box` from Data Science series on [Coursera](http://Coursera.com). Hope I'll get the statement soon. :D
* Good night.

##2015.03.25
* Do something just for once is not that hard, but to do it everyday is very hard for anyone(except eating sort of things.:D)
* I want to make it happen. My dream, my future.
* Today I wrote ex5 to ex14 from Learn Python the Hard Way and found it really is doing some help! And I'm trying to practice my input because sometimes I would just make a lot of typos.
* I want to keep a good life style, so, good night.

##2015.03.26
* I spent most of the day worrying about my club, which is funny because you know what you are worrying about is not what you think it is. The only thing that we fear is fear itself.
* I made some Photoshop work also, and uploaded some photos for people to give me some feedback. I think this is some sort of effective way to improve your skill. Because people see what you cannot see. As an author, you know what you want to convey behind the photo, but they don't. What they can do is just feel and guess. So if they see something totally different from yours, then it makes you ponder.
* Of course I did my daily python work today, 5 exs if I recall correctly. These exs are getting harder-you need to understand rather than just type it.
* Like I said yesterday, good life style, good night.

##2015.03.27
* I think I'm going to give myself a rest. Take a day off. Because this is Friday and there is a party waiting for me!
* Also, I've come to the exercise asking me to read some code before I go any further into python. So, it's OK to have some fun and read some codes.
* You may ask why I am writing this instead of going out right now? Well, I have to admit that I kind of like this diary-like note. I used to be a guy who didn't like to write diary at all. I've tried a lot of times. They all went for several days and died. It really surprises me that I would ever have this kind of feeling right now.
* I'm going to karaoke by myself. :D (Turns out to be a good way to relive in a rainy day after so many stressed days.)
* Good night.(This is to the other end of Mother Earth. :P) 

##2015.03.28
* I'm at home right now.
* Had a dinner with my elder sister and her husband, with all the two family members.
* It's natural to get tired after such a feast.
* So, I think I'd better to have a shower and embrace my bed.
* Good night, everyone.

##2015.03.29
* Today my time was mostly spent on transportation. (I don't like this.
* I read some pages from `Python cookbook` but I think it is for those experienced guys, right? What I need now is a small project like the address book project I should've been doing.
* But procrastination...oh, no. And some fear? Also some laziness. They all come together and you just can't do it. You just shy away. (is this phrase correct?)
* I did learn something, though. I'm taking (failing) the R Programming course on Coursera, so I played with swirl(a package in R making learning R fun and easy) a while, but still I need to take lessons and finish the projects. Oh, that all starts (the) next month. All over again. A new start.
* I must be some kind of crazy, so as usual, Good night fellows.

##2015.03.30
* Hi, I'm back here.
* Today I am back again to the `Learn python the hard way`(sorry about the capitalization). I found it quite helpful that you leave what you're doing for some time and jump back. It just all comes back to you and you can oddly figure out things that you don't understand before. It's like, in Chinese Internet terms, "duang~" and your life changed. :D
* I also did some R practice. With the help of swirl, I now also find it easy to learn R. What's really hard is to know and learn the math & stats behind the language. And I'm unfortunately not such a math guy.
* But who knows? Years back I'd never think that I can actually program. You know, like writing / reading files and make changes to them and save, stuff like that. So, really you can do everything you want / dream to do. As long as you give it a shot and keep going, better everyday.
* I'll pick up my Data Science again. (which I failed yet again recently) And I make a solemn promise here that ***I will make it.***
* Fellows, life is so short. Come on and get your hands on something you want to do. If you find nothing you want to do. Then do something good to the community, and you'll find out.
* As always, Good night.

##2015.03.31
* Today is my first 10-days streak on Github. Wow, I have to congratulate myself because I have never ever did a 10 days recording of my life for my whole life.( Can you understand this?)
* But sadly, I didn't do any program today.
* In fact, I went to a job fair in my school and found a quite good job as an English teacher (which has always been one of my dreams). To make it better, I found that the HR there was such a beauty (which made me go to talk with her for a quite long time, hahaha).
* And the day after tomorrow I'll have an real interview in that company, hope I'll get the offer, haha!
* Another thing is that I made something happen, which in English was quite hard to explain, it's all about the club I founded and we got some permit from the university (which will definitely help the club to grow faster and stronger).
* Enough of daily story, and Good night fellows. :D
