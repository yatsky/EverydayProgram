#Write down what I learned everyday

##2015.03.22
* Learned how to read from a file in Python
* How to create a text file
* How to in/output
* Even practiced a little bit with Git (amazing tool, though can be hard to use)
* And here I'm using Markdown!(found myself quite love reading out its name...)

##2015.03.23
* Learned the difference between open+'w' and open+'a' (which caused some trouble)
* Tried to dump some pictures from Web but failed :(
* Got more familiar with Git, found myself understood those messy instuctions now :)
* Add new function to my little program

##2015.03.24
* Spent most of the day trying to figure out how to use SSH instead of https, so frustrating... And it just come to me when I was going to give up and this was from a blog teaching you how to set up a blog website using GitHub. :(
* Wrote 4 python exercises from `Learn Python the Hard Way` since I've read `A byte of python`. Typed a lot of things.
* Tried to figure out how to set up a blog using Ruby, bundler and jekelly but failed. Tried Hexo but also failed. I have to admit that I really need a teacher! (clearly not myself!)
* Got more and more familiar with Git, which is definitely a good thing!
* Finished my first course `Data Scientist's tool box` from Data Science series on [Coursera](http://Coursera.com). Hope I'll get the statement soon. :D
* Good night.
