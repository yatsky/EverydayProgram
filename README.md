#Write down what I learned everyday

##2015.03.22
* Learned how to read from a file in Python
* How to create a text file
* How to in/output
* Even practiced a little bit with Git (amazing tool, though can be hard to use)
* And here I'm using Markdown!(found myself quite love reading out its name...)

##2015.03.23
* Learned the difference between open+'w' and open+'a' (which caused some trouble)
* Tried to dump some pictures from Web but failed :(
* Got more familiar with Git, found myself understood those messy instuctions now :)
* Add new function to my little program

##2015.03.24
* Spent most of the day trying to figure out how to use SSH instead of https, so frustrating... And it just come to me when I was going to give up and this was from a blog teaching you how to set up a blog website using GitHub. :(
* Wrote 4 python exercises from `Learn Python the Hard Way` since I've read `A byte of python`. Typed a lot of things.
* Tried to figure out how to set up a blog using Ruby, bundler and jekelly but failed. Tried Hexo but also failed. I have to admit that I really need a teacher! (clearly not myself!)
* Got more and more familiar with Git, which is definitely a good thing!
* Finished my first course `Data Scientist's tool box` from Data Science series on [Coursera](http://Coursera.com). Hope I'll get the statement soon. :D
* Good night.

* Do something just for once is not that hard, but to do it everyday is very hard for anyone(except eating sort of things.:D)
* I want to make it happen. My dream, my future.
* Today I wrote ex5 to ex14 from Learn Python the Hard Way and found it really is doing some help! And I'm trying to practice my input because sometimes I would just make a lot of typos.
* I want to keep a good life style, so, good night.

##2015.03.26
* I spent most of the day worrying about my club, which is funny because you know what you are worrying about is not what you think it is. The only thing that we fear is fear itself.
* I made some Photoshop work also, and uploaded some photos for people to give me some feedback. I think this is some sort of effective way to improve your skill. Because people see what you cannot see. As an author, you know what you want to convey behind the photo, but they don't. What they can do is just feel and guess. So if they see something totally different from yours, then it makes you ponder.
* Of course I did my daily python work today, 5 exs if I recall correctly. These exs are getting harder-you need to understand rather than just type it.
* Like I said yesterday, good life style, good night.
