#Write down what I learned everyday

##2015.03.22
* Learned how to read from a file in Python
* How to create a text file
* How to in/output
* Even practiced a little bit with Git (amazing tool, though can be hard to use)
* And here I'm using Markdown!(found myself quite love reading out its name...)

##2015.03.23
* Learned the difference between open+'w' and open+'a' (which caused some trouble)
* Tried to dump some pictures from Web but failed :(
* Got more familiar with Git, found myself understood those messy instuctions now :)
* Add new function to my little program

##2015.03.24
* Spent most of the day trying to figure out how to use SSH instead of https, so frustrating... And it just come to me when I was going to give up and this was from a blog teaching you how to set up a blog website using GitHub. :(
* Wrote 4 python exercises from `Learn Python the Hard Way` since I've read `A byte of python`. Typed a lot of things.
* Tried to figure out how to set up a blog using Ruby, bundler and jekelly but failed. Tried Hexo but also failed. I have to admit that I really need a teacher! (clearly not myself!)
* Got more and more familiar with Git, which is definitely a good thing!
* Finished my first course `Data Scientist's tool box` from Data Science series on [Coursera](http://Coursera.com). Hope I'll get the statement soon. :D
* Good night.

##2015.03.25
* Do something just for once is not that hard, but to do it everyday is very hard for anyone(except eating sort of things.:D)
* I want to make it happen. My dream, my future.
* Today I wrote ex5 to ex14 from Learn Python the Hard Way and found it really is doing some help! And I'm trying to practice my input because sometimes I would just make a lot of typos.
* I want to keep a good life style, so, good night.

##2015.03.26
* I spent most of the day worrying about my club, which is funny because you know what you are worrying about is not what you think it is. The only thing that we fear is fear itself.
* I made some Photoshop work also, and uploaded some photos for people to give me some feedback. I think this is some sort of effective way to improve your skill. Because people see what you cannot see. As an author, you know what you want to convey behind the photo, but they don't. What they can do is just feel and guess. So if they see something totally different from yours, then it makes you ponder.
* Of course I did my daily python work today, 5 exs if I recall correctly. These exs are getting harder-you need to understand rather than just type it.
* Like I said yesterday, good life style, good night.

##2015.03.27
* I think I'm going to give myself a rest. Take a day off. Because this is Friday and there is a party waiting for me!
* Also, I've come to the exercise asking me to read some code before I go any further into python. So, it's OK to have some fun and read some codes.
* You may ask why I am writing this instead of going out right now? Well, I have to admit that I kind of like this diary-like note. I used to be a guy who didn't like to write diary at all. I've tried a lot of times. They all went for several days and died. It really surprises me that I would ever have this kind of feeling right now.
* I'm going to karaoke by myself. :D (Turns out to be a good way to relive in a rainy day after so many stressed days.)
* Good night.(This is to the other end of Mother Earth. :P) 

##2015.03.28
* I'm at home right now.
* Had a dinner with my elder sister and her husband, with all the two family members.
* It's natural to get tired after such a feast.
* So, I think I'd better to have a shower and embrace my bed.
* Good night, everyone.

##2015.03.29
* Today my time was mostly spent on transportation. (I don't like this.
* I read some pages from `Python cookbook` but I think it is for those experienced guys, right? What I need now is a small project like the address book project I should've been doing.
* But procrastination...oh, no. And some fear? Also some laziness. They all come together and you just can't do it. You just shy away. (is this phrase correct?)
* I did learn something, though. I'm taking (failing) the R Programming course on Coursera, so I played with swirl(a package in R making learning R fun and easy) a while, but still I need to take lessons and finish the projects. Oh, that all starts (the) next month. All over again. A new start.
* I must be some kind of crazy, so as usual, Good night fellows.

##2015.03.30
* Hi, I'm back here.
* Today I am back again to the `Learn python the hard way`(sorry about the capitalization). I found it quite helpful that you leave what you're doing for some time and jump back. It just all comes back to you and you can oddly figure out things that you don't understand before. It's like, in Chinese Internet terms, "duang~" and your life changed. :D
* I also did some R practice. With the help of swirl, I now also find it easy to learn R. What's really hard is to know and learn the math & stats behind the language. And I'm unfortunately not such a math guy.
* But who knows? Years back I'd never think that I can actually program. You know, like writing / reading files and make changes to them and save, stuff like that. So, really you can do everything you want / dream to do. As long as you give it a shot and keep going, better everyday.
* I'll pick up my Data Science again. (which I failed yet again recently) And I make a solemn promise here that ***I will make it.***
* Fellows, life is so short. Come on and get your hands on something you want to do. If you find nothing you want to do. Then do something good to the community, and you'll find out.
* As always, Good night.

##2015.03.31
* Today is my first 10-days streak on Github. Wow, I have to congratulate myself because I have never ever did a 10 days recording of my life for my whole life.( Can you understand this?)
* But sadly, I didn't do any program today.
* In fact, I went to a job fair in my school and found a quite good job as an English teacher (which has always been one of my dreams). To make it better, I found that the HR there was such a beauty (which made me go to talk with her for a quite long time, hahaha).
* And the day after tomorrow I'll have an real interview in that company, hope I'll get the offer, haha!
* Another thing is that I made something happen, which in English was quite hard to explain, it's all about the club I founded and we got some permit from the university (which will definitely help the club to grow faster and stronger).
* Enough of daily story, and Good night fellows. :D

##2015.04.01
* Fool's day
* I fooled myself.
* What the f*ck
* What the f*ck
* What the f*ck
* I need to have a break
* Upgraded my phone without backup
* Today I just want to say Goodbye world.
* Very upset here.

##2015.04.02
* Had a job interview and it was rather comforting.
* Maybe I will be an English teacher soon.
* Also had a `分享会`(well I don't know how to say this in English), it's all about running and emotion management. However I found it quite boring....
* Watched the first episode of ***Yes, Prime Minister***. It was quite fun even though the whole show was not that HD.
* Talked to several guys and I am really getting better.
* 2mr I will program again.
* Good Night, fellows.

##2015.04.03
* I'm terrible at keeping promises. And I didn't program today. It's really a shame.
* The day after tomorrow is the Chinese `清明` Festival, during which we commemorate our ancestors. So I will be spending almost the whole tomorrow in the car going my hometown, Wenzhou. Traffic jam is always an inevitable thing.
* I have to get up early tomorrow, so everyone, Good night and code. 

##2015.04.04
* Just for the record.
* Today was hard to explain everything.
* So tired after 4 hours of driving (well, actually I was sitting at the back of the car.
* And all the chats they had got me quite uncomfortable. But you have to live with this.
* So much for today. See you tomorrow.
* Good Night, fellows.

##2015.04.05
* Well, it suddenly hits me that this note should be something about my *Everyday programming* and not this daily-things-note down...
* But this is actually really helping me to record my moods and thoughts of the day so I'd like to keep it this way.
* Here begins the Chinese note-down.
* 今天早上去给爷爷奶奶上了坟，磕了头。生命的力量真是顽强，不管是我们多少次把坟头清理干净，每次去的时候也总是苔藓和一些小树占据了所有的视线。郁郁葱葱的绿色就像是宫崎骏先生的动画那样动人。翠绿翠绿的苔藓和从石块中长出来的小树，好像是爷爷奶奶生命的延续，它们继续在这世界上生长着，似乎要长到这世界的末日——天昏地暗也无法阻止它们。
* 后来又去了崖下岩，最近才出来的景点，其实跟普通的景点没有什么不同，不过我倒是第一次走在悬崖底下，然后沿着峭壁上的栈道爬上去，还站在了玻璃观景台上向下望了望。作为一个有恐高症的人我真是差点吓死，后来还走了铁索桥，OMG，给跪了，根本不敢往下看。
* 景色真的是很不错的，我真的已经很少能在城市开到那种能反射月光的云了——城里的云或是雾霾都是不断在进行漫反射。
* 明天就要回杭州了，下一次再来不知道又是什么时候，再见。
* Good night, fellows.

##2015.04.06
* The day in the car..
* So, so, so, so, tired...
* Good night.

##2015.04.07
* Got a lot things to do.
* Don't know what to do.
* Wasted a lot of time.
* Sigh and sad.
* Good night.

##2015.04.08
* Had my first training class in Cagoo. Ivy was really professional I'd say.
* And met Kevin, a handsome guy from Bingjiang District, who is going to teach the same course like I do.
* Finally launched the big project of my running club.
* OK, tomorrow I'll have my first driver's test and good luck to me!
* Good night to you.

##2015.04.09
* Got my self an MBA, so you know, have to stay with it for some time.
* Good night!

##2015.04.10
* It's hard to make your own living, I'm now beginning to understand my parents, really.
* When I fell asleep on the bus, a guy woke me when it was the final stop. Thank him.
* My first training class actually went pretty well, and I think the next one will be better.
* I should come back to programming before long.
* Right after I finish configuring my MBA.
* And getting git into work is one of the configurations.
* This is going to be a fairly early Good night.
* Anyway, Good night, fellows.

##2015.04.11
* Restarted my R programming language(hope I'll get it through this time)
* Restarted my translation mission. :D
* I should figure out how to use iTunes now.
* Well, it seems that you cannot use iTunes to buy any music here in China, so I give up...
* I restarted my python journey. I hope it will come along with R.
* Today was quite good and long, I kind of like this feeling of hard-working(hope I'll still feel like this tomorrow :D)
* This MBA is awosome on battery life!!!
* Time to leave the libary of knowledge and go back to student apartment.
* Have some fun and rest, you guys too.
* Good night, everyone.

##2015.04.12
* I find that when you start do something new, you'll live a day like week, and a week like a month. It's just like that you were back to the old days when you were a child and got the most time of the world. You felt like a day never passed quick enough and you were always wondering why weren't you an grown-up then.
* I don't know if you guys feel it this way. You may share your idea here (where I haven't prepared a place for you to share, that's awkward.)
* Ah ha! Two girls(elder than me) told me that they would help me find a girlfriend, and asked me what are my criteria. Actually I felt that they were all quite fit to my criteria.(except that they are elder than me)
* Well, another thing is that I love Mac! Yes, I do! It's fast, light, beautiful. It has a great battery life and it has a wonderful UI. Oh, but I'm not saying my old heavy computer is that bad. They are just for different purposes, since MBA cannot do any heavy work like video editting or after effects.
* OK, it seems that I've been writing so many things today, which by the way, is good I think, but it's time to say good night.
* (I suddenly found this MBA's edge too sharp that my arm nearly got cut)
* Anyway, Good night, fellows.

##2015.04.13
* I thought VMware Fusion is free...
* There is some kind of virtual machine that is free.
* But I just can't remember, so sad.
* Did nothing today.
* Though I got lots of things to do.
* I want to live at home.
* Oh, don't know what I'm saying
* So let's just finish today.
* Good night, everyone. Nice dream.

##2015.04.14
* A bit tired today.
* I hope I can be a better teacher someday.
* Or maybe a better man, I'd say.
* My eyes are soring so much, I'd better stop here.
* Good Night, everyone.
